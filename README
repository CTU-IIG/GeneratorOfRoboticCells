The purpose of this program is to generate optimization problems (datasets)
for the energy optimization of robotic cells.

Prerequisites:
1) good C++11 compiler
2) CMake 2.8.4 and newer
3) optionally doxygen for generation of documentation

How to install on Linux, MacOS, and Unix-like systems:
1) download and extract the source codes of this program
2) enter the directory with the extracted files
3) create and enter a separate building directory: 'mkdir build/; cd build/'
3) configure the program: 'cmake [options] ../'
	a) you can specify installation path by '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=...'
	b) configuration can be alternatively changed by: 'ccmake ../'
4) compile the program: 'make'
	a) add '-jN' option to accelerate build process by using N processes
5) generate the documentation (optional): 'make doc'
6) install the program (and documentation): 'make install'
	a) installed files are recorded in 'install_manifest.txt' file

How to install on Windows:
1) download and extract the source codes of this program
2) run cmake-gui command (from command line or select it from the menu)
3) select the source code directory
4) create a build directory and select it in cmake-gui
5) configure it to generate e.g. *.sln project
6) open it in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or newer
	a) build the source codes
	b) install the program

Execution of the program:
Enter a directory with the program executable, which depends on the
installation path ("generator/bin/" by default), and execute the following
command to print the program help:

'./GeneratorOfDatasets --help'

Existing datasets and the generation of new ones:
Our generated datasets and the used project configurations are located
at 'datasets/' directory after the extraction of source codes.
If you would like to check whether a generated/written dataset
is valid against the xml schema (file named "dataset.xsd" in "xmlschema/")
execute the following command:

'xmllint --noout --schema dataset.xsd your_dataset.xml'
